# Exercise 3

In this exercise, we study text categorization using the [20
newsgroups](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/theo-20/www/data/news20.html)
dataset.

## Tasks

### Task 1

Run both models and compare the accuracies and runtimes.

### Task 2

Pick either model and try to improve the results, e.g., by tweaking the model or the training parameters (optimizer, batch size, number of epochs, etc.).
