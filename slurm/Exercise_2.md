# Exercise 5

In this exercise, we study image classification with two datasets, 
[dogs vs. cats](imgs/dvc.png) and [traffic signs](imgs/gtsrb-montage.png).

## Files

### TF2/Keras

* *tf2-dvc-cnn-simple.py*: Dogs vs. cats with a CNN trained from scratch
* *tf2-dvc-cnn-pretrained.py*: Dogs vs. cats with a pre-trained CNN
* *tf2-dvc-cnn-evaluate.py*: Evaluate a trained CNN with test data
* *tf2-gtsrb-cnn-simple.py*: Traffic signs with a CNN trained from scratch
* *tf2-gtsrb-cnn-pretrained.py*: Traffic signs with a pre-trained CNN
* *tf2-gtsrb-cnn-evaluate.py*: Evaluate a trained CNN with test data

### PyTorch

The PyTorch scripts have a slightly different setup:

* *pytorch_dvc_cnn_simple.py*: Dogs vs. cats with a CNN trained from scratch
* *pytorch_dvc_cnn_pretrained.py*: Dogs vs. cats with a pre-trained CNN
* *pytorch_gtsrb_cnn_simple.py*: Traffic signs with a CNN trained from scratch
* *pytorch_gtsrb_cnn_pretrained.py*: Traffic signs with a pre-trained CNN

There is no separate evaluation script, instead the test set
evaluation is done automatically after training.

## Tasks

### Task 1

Starting with the _dogs vs. cats_ (dvc) database, train, evaluate and report the
accuracy with both scripts. Note that the pretrained script actually produces
two models (with and without fine-tuning).

Which model gave the best result? Does finetuning improve the result?

Finally, repeat the experiment with the _Traffic signs_ (gtsrb) database . Which
model gives the best result? Compare the results with the dvc database.

### Task 2

Pick one database (dvc or gtsrb) and try to improve the result, e.g., by
tweaking the model or the training parameters (optimizer, batch size, number of
epochs, etc.).

### Extracurricular 1

There are scripts of _dogs vs. cats_ with data in TFRecord format. Take a look at the differences in data preprocessing.

* *tf2-dvc_tfr-cnn-simple.py*: Dogs vs. cats with a CNN trained from scratch
* *tf2-dvc_tfr-cnn-pretrained.py*: Dogs vs. cats with a pre-trained CNN
* *tf2-dvc_tfr-cnn-evaluate.py*: Evaluate a trained CNN with test data

### Extracurricular 2

There is another, small dataset `avp`, of [aliens and predators](imgs/avp.png). Modify dogs vs. cats to classify between them.
